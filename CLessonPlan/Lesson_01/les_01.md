# C LANGUAGE

C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. It is a widely used, high-level language that can be used to develop operating systems, as well as applications for a variety of purposes, including scientific and engineering applications, business software, and video games.

C is known for its efficiency, flexibility, and portability, making it a popular choice for developing operating systems, system software, and a wide range of applications. It is also a popular language for learning to program, as it provides a strong foundation in computer science concepts and is widely used in academia and industry.

Here is an example of a simple "Hello, World!" program in C:

`#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}`

C code is typically compiled, meaning that it is translated into machine code that can be executed on a computer. This allows C programs to be run on a variety of different platforms without requiring any changes to the code.
